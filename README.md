The goal for this app is to track accountability and habits for new skills you're hoping to develop. 

I'm building it first in React, then will update it from JS to TS, *then* will make it an electron app. I'll be working on this most days, but this is my first React project that I'm working on without guidance or help in any way. I'm enjoying the challenge and I will continue to work on it consistently. I have no predictions on when this project will be finished, but I'm enjoying the process.
